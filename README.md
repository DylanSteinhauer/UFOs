# UFOs
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to use Javascript, HTML, and d3 to create an interactive webpage containing UFO sightings that can be filtered by
date, city, state, country, and shape.
## Results

There are five filters you can use for your search; and you can use any combination of these filters to narrow down the results. 
For the state and country filters, you must use the two letter abbreviation associated with them. For example, New Mexico is abbreviated as 'nm'.\

Here is an example using the filters. When we filter by California and the "formation" shaped UFO, it returns two sightings. 
Both sightings were reported as three red lights seen high in the sky.
